# SMS (School Management System)
Would you like to have a better system for managing school records free of charge? If you do, then our interests are aligned. And I believe we can achieve it.

This was the first project I did when learning Filament, a package of Laravel. However, after spending time learning, going through the available school management systems, I believe we can have better systems for our schools. And this is my contriution to making our education systems better.

## Modules
- Fees Management.
- Students Management.
- School Administration.
- Role assignments using shield.
