# SFMS (School Fees Management System)
SFMS was a simple project I did when I was learning to use Laravel's Filament package. I focused on the finance aspect of a school setup, defined the relevant objects, linked their relationships and eventually utilized the features of filament to actualize the project.

## Modules
- Fees Management.
- Students Management.
- School Administration.
- Role assignments using shield.

# How to install
